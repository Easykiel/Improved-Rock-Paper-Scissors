# Improved-Rock-Paper-Scissors

This project is a simple website that users can play rock paper scissors with a computer. The game goes for five rounds and then checks who has the most points. The site displays all necessary information to the user.

## What the Project Uses
The project is made purely from HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It uses the basics of DOM Methods and a simple button Event Listener. DOM manipulation is used to alter the texts within the HTML. The project also uses simple game logic to play Rock Paper Scissors.
